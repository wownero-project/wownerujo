        <p>If you need a new Wownero Address!</p>
        <p>Enter a unique wallet name and password.
        The password is used for securing your wallet data on the device. Use a strong password -
        even better use a passphrase.</p>
        <h2>Note your Mnemonic Seed!</h2>
        <p>On the following screen you will find your 25-word \"Mnemonic Seed\".
        This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later point
        and gain full access to your funds.
        Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em>
        full access to your funds!</p>
        <p>If you lose your wallet password, you can still recover your wallet with the Mnemonic Seed.</p>
        <p>There is no way to recover your Mnemonic Seed, if you lose it all your funds will be lost!
        The Mnemonic Seed can also never be changed, and if it is stolen or otherwise compromised,
        you will have to move your funds to new wallet (with a new Mnemonic Seed). Therefore, it is best
        that you backup your Mnemonic Seed by writing it down and storing it in <em>multiple</em> safe
        and secure places.</p>

        <h1>Rahakoti info</h1>
        <h2>Avalik aadress</h2>
        Your public address is like your bank account number you can share this with anyone without
        having to fear losing your Wownero. People will send Wownero to your wallet using this address.
        <h2>Mnemooniline seeme</h2>
        This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later point and gain full access to
        your funds. Keeping this private and secure is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em> full
        access to your Wownero! If you haven’t written this down somewhere safe please do!
        <h2>Rahakoti failide taastamise parool</h2>
        Make sure you write this password down. If you reset your device or uninstall the app, you
        will need it to access your wallet again.<br/>
        <h3>CrAzYpass</h3>
        If the password displayed here is 52 alphanumeric characters in groups of 4 - congratulations!
        Your wallet files are secured with a 256-bit key generated by your device&apos;s security
        features based on the passphrase you chose (on creation or by changing it). This makes it
        extremely difficult to hack!<br/>
        This feature is mandatory for all newly created wallets.
        <h3>Vananenud parool</h3>
        If you see your passphrase here, your wallet files are not as secure as when using
        a CrAzYpass. To fix this, simply select \"Change Passphrase\" from the menu. After entering
        a new passphrase (maybe even the same one as before) the app will generate a CrAzYpass for
        you and secure your wallet files with it. Write it down!
        <h3>CrAzYpass rahakotid</h3>
        If you ever need to reinstall Wownerujo (for example after resetting your phone or switching
        to a new one) or you want to use your wallet files on a different device or PC, you have to
        use this Recovery Password in order to access your wallet again.<br/>
        By selecting \"Change Passphrase\" from the menu, you can choose another passphrase. Beware
        that this will generate a new Recovery Password. Write it down!
        <h2>Vaatamise võti</h2>
        Your view key can be used to monitor incoming transactions to your wallet without giving
        permission to spend the funds inside your wallet.
        <h2>Kulutamise võti</h2>
        Your spend key allows anyone to spend the Wownero associated with your wallet, so don’t tell
        anyone this key, keep it safe like your Mnemonic Seed.

        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>Wownerujo uses a Remote Node to communicate with the Wownero Network without having
        to download and store a copy of the whole blockchain itself. You can find a list of popular
        remote nodes or learn how to run your own remote node here https://moneroworld.com/<p>
        <p>Wownerujo comes with some Remote Nodes preset. It remembers the last five nodes used.</p>
        <h2>Rahakotid</h2>
        <p>Here you see your wallets. They are located in the <tt>monerujo</tt> folder
        in the internal storage of your device. You can use a file explorer app to see them.
        You should make backups of this folder on a regular basis to off-device storage in
        case your device explodes or gets stolen.</p>
        <p>Select a wallet to open it or press the \"+\" to create a new one.

        <h3>Tagavarakoopia</h3>
        <p>Make a copy of the wallet in the <tt>backups</tt> folder inside the <tt>monerujo</tt>
        overwriting previous copies there.</p>
        <h3>Arhiveeri</h3>
        <p>Make a backup and delete the wallet afterwards. The copy remains in the <tt>backups</tt>
        folder. If you no longer need your backups you should delete them with a file explorer or
        secure delete app.</p>

        <h2>Uuendamine</h2>
        Because Wownero likes to keep things private, every time you open a Wownerujo wallet we have to
        scan the blockchain to see if any new Wowneroj have been sent to your wallet, this only
        stores information to your phone which belongs to your wallet. Sometimes it can take a while
        because you haven’t synced in a long time.
        <h2>Kontojääk</h2>
        <p><b>Help! My wallet balance has disappeared or is unconfirmed!</b><br/>
        Don’t panic! When you send funds from your wallet, some of your balance will temporarily show
        as unconfirmed.
        This happens as a result of how Wownero is exchanged on the blockchain and how change works.

        <h1>Ülekannete info</h1>
        <h2>Sihtkoht</h2>
        This is the public address of the wallet you sent Wownero to
        <h2>Ülekande ID (TX ID)</h2>
        This is your Transaction ID you can use it to identify your obfuscated transaction on a Wownero
        Blockchain explorer like <a href="https://xmrchain.net/">https://xmrchain.net/</a>
        <h2>Ülekande võti (TX KEY)</h2>
        This is your transaction private key, keep this safe as revealing this to a third party
        reveals which signature in a ring is yours, thereby making your transaction transparent.
        <h2>Plokk</h2>
        This was the block your transaction was included in.

    <string name="help_send"><![CDATA[
        <h1>Saatmine</h1>
        <h2>Saaja aadress</h2>
        <p>This is the public address of the wallet you are sending Wowneroj to, you can copy this from
        your clipboard, scan a QR code or enter it manually. Make sure you triple check this to
        ensure you aren’t sending coins to the wrong address.</p>
        <h2><em>Ring<em>\'i suurus</h2>
        <p>There are a number of ring sizes to choose from in Wownerujo. If you are a beginner user
        we recommend you stick with a ring size of 7. Increasing the ring size above 7 increases
        the amount of signers in a ring signature, theoretically providing increased plausible
        deniability. However setting high ring sizes can also make your transaction stand out on
        the blockchain.</p>
        <h2>Tähtsus</h2>
        <p>This setting determines the speed at which your transaction will be included in the
        blockchain. A high priority setting will correlate directly with a higher transaction fee
        and the inverse is true for a low priority. Please note that if you set your transaction to
        a low priority it can be hours before it is included on the blockchain. The default priority
        is \"Medium\".</p>
